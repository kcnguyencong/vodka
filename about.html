					<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
					<p>Hey there, I'm Cong - an UI/UX designer. Currently I am working at a fintech company, my job is to be in charge of UI/UX for several domains on company's website and mobile app such as finance, lending, pawn loans management, talent acquisition and human resource.
					My major is tending to focus on management services (products, users, policy), product configuration... which require in-depth knowledge of business and consistent vision across the product lifecycle from installation, configuration steps til deliver the product to the customers. According to my experience, the smooth and effecient collaboration between stakeholders in UI/UX design process is one of the key factors to build an excellent product. Beside UI/UX, I have many-years experience in HTML/CSS. I am enrolling in Google UX Design Course and getting certified soon.</p>
